I am a MPhil student at $AVC^2$ Lab, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), working under the supervision of Prof. Ce Zhu and collaborating closely with Prof. Le Zhang. Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Glasgow College, UESTC.

My current research focuses on complex scene understanding, particularly in camouflaged object segmentation. I am also interested in multimodal large language models (LLMs) and the generation of images and videos.

I welcome collaboration opportunities. Please feel free to contact me directly through email.
